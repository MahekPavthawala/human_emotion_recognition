## About

Humans express their emotions on regular basis. Each second of their life is a 
reaction towards something. Different situation calls for the different emotion. As 
holidays are close enough, people feel happiness, if something doesnâ€™t go according 
to their plan, they feel sad or angry, and for the normal routine days, they are neutral, 
or disgusted, or afraid of something. That means us humans, conveys everything 
with our emotions. For example, a person is standing on a bridge, might show 
complex emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, disgust and so much more and detect 
of such emotions is necessary sometime in the real-life situations. This model 
demonstrates the learning capability of the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with 
the goal of image classification for the Human Emotion. There are 7 classes of 
emotions and a network is created to understand such complex human emotion from 
the collected image dataset. Here, various images are present with the goal that a 
neural network can train them and identify the emotion the image is exhibiting.
